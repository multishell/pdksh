#   	File name completion (^X,*) does not mesh well with cd and
#   	symbolic links.  cd does path simplification wrt $PWD before
#   	doing the actual chdir(), while file name completion does
#   	not do the simplification. E.g., you are in directory A
#   	which has a symbolic link to directory B, you create a file
#   	called foobar and you then cd to the symlink to B, and type
#   		$ echo ../foo^X
#   	and the shell beeps at you.  Would be more consistent to
#   	do the completion after simplifing the `$PWD/..'.

	Parsing of $(..) expressions is non-optimal.  It is
	impossible to have any parentheses inside the expression.
	I.e.,
		$ ksh -c 'echo $(echo \( )'
		no closing quote
		$ ksh -c 'echo $(echo "(" )'
		no closing quote
		$
	The solution is to hack the parsing clode in lex.c, the
	question is how to hack it: should any parentheses be
	escaped by a backslash, or should recursive parsing be done
	(so quotes could also be used to hide hem).  The former is
	easier, the later better...
