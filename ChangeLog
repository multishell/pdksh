	* Updated MACHINES.
	* Placed source under CVS.  This should help with processing fixes
	from the field.

	* Cleaned up the build process slightly.  Makefiles in ./std tree
	now maintain objects within the libraries rather than simply
	building the .o's and archiving them.  Of course the make(1) used
	must know how to maintain libraries :-)

	* Added bug.report as a template for bug reporting.

	* Source in ./sh can be built independently of ./std tree if
	desired.  See comments in ./sh/Makefile.

	* As originally distributed some of libstdc.a was not used and
	libposix.a was not used at all.  On Sun's this highlighted a bug
	(incompatibility) in the times() call.  Now the ./std/libs are
	used fully, and the supplied times() call functions as expected.
