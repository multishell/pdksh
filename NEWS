Version 5.0.6

* most reported bugs/problems fixed (all but two)

* temporary files now created in $TMPDIR (if it is a sane path)

Version 5.0.5

* function parsing POSIXized (function bodies can be any compound command,
  redirections after functions effect function invocation, not the
  instantiation, the () in a function definition now parsed as two tokens).

* exit bultin now does stopped jobs check.

* set -p/-o priviliged supported.

* test builtin now believed to be completely posix.

* a default path is now used when PATH is not set (defined in options.h).

Version 5.0.4

* configuration checks for buggy opendir()s and setpgrp()s.

* autoloading functions now supported.

* functions can safely redefine themselves.

Version 5.0.3

* hash command changed to "alias -t"; whence -p added; print -s added
  (all as in at&t ksh); unalias -a added (POSIX).

* test builtin POSIX complient

* TMOUT parameter supported (at&t ksh: timeout interactive shells)

Version 5.0.2

* trap/error handling changed to eliminate longjmp()s from signal handlers;
  trap ERR added.

* ksh conditional expressions ([[ .. ]]) supported.

* arithmetic expressions (let, $((..)), etc.) now understand full C
  integer expressions (except ++/-- and sizeof()).

* typeset -L -R -Z -u -l added (ala at&t ksh)

* at&t/posix $(( .. )) arithmetic expansions supported.

Version 5.0.1

* set -e no longer effects commands executed as part of if/while/until/&&/||/!
  condition.

* posix ! keyword now recognized.

* posix getopts; if not in posix mode, getopts will accept options starting
  with + (at&t kshism)

* syntax error messages improved (says what was unexpected/unmatched)

Version 4.9+mun.5

* all known bugs related to job control fixed:
    * fg,bg,jobs,wait,kill commands fully POSIX complient
    * signals are no longer reported for foreground jobs killed by SIGINT and
      SIGPIPE
    * pipeline process groups now created more reliablely (was a problem
      if first process exited before second process exec'd).
    * "(: ; cat /etc/termcap) | sleep" nolonger hangs

* save/restore tty mode if command succeeds/fails, respectively.  Edit
  mode (emacs,vi) no longer use old tty mode information

* test command: added -h

* alternations option renamed to braceexpand (eg, use set -o braceexpand).
  Old usage (set -o alternations) still accepted (will disappear in next
  version).

* trap/kill now accept upper and lower case signal names.

Version 4.9+mun.3

* here documents in functions now work properly

* read command: added -s option, use REPLY if no variable specified

* don't accept "while command; done" as a valid command

* fg,bg,jobs,wait,kill commands mostly POSIX complient.

* unset command: added POSIX -v option

* set command: added -A option

* handle ${array[@]} and ${array[*]}

* compiles with old bsd 4.2 compiler (pcc)

* new versions of etc/profile and etc/ksh.profile

Version 4.9+mun.2 (versus 4.9)

* directory/file structure has been re-arranged:
    * moved files from sh directory up a level, deleted sh directory
    * created misc directory, old ChangeLog,README,.. files moved to misc

* now uses GNU autoconf for compilation.

* no longer uses stdio FILE *'s for I/O redirection (most stdio
  usage has been removed).  Solves many porting problems caused by
  dup'd file descriptors, forked processes and exiting.

* removed lint from code (compiles with very few warning with gcc -O -Wall
  -Wno-comment)

* has array support (needs work but is pretty functional).

* ulimit command now more functional on more machines. Compatable with at&t ksh.

* command line and set option parsing cleaned up, POSIXized.

* POSIX IFS handling.

* many many small bug fixes (see ChangeLog)
