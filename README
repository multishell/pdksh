Last updated Sept '94 for pdksh-5.0.6.

PD-ksh is a mostly complete AT&T ksh look-alike (see NOTES file for a list
of things not supported).  Work is currently underway to make it fully
compatible with both POSIX and AT&T ksh (when the two don't conflict).

Since pdksh is free and compiles and runs on most common unix systems, it
is very useful in creating a consistent user interface across multiple
machines.  For example, in the CS dept. of MUN, pdksh is installed on a
variety of machines including Suns, HPs, DecStations, pcs running Linux,
etc., and is the login shell of ~2500 users (note that they aren't using the
current alpha test version, but an older version).

PDksh is currently being maintained by Michael Rendell (michael@cs.mun.ca),
who took over from Simon J. Gerraty (sjg@zen.void.oz.au) at the later's
suggestion.  A short list of things that have been done since the
last public pdksh release (4.9) are auto-configuration, arrays, $(( .. )),
[[ .. ]], variable attributes, many POSIXisms and many bug fixes.  See the
NEWS and ChangeLog files for other features added and bugs fixed.

Note that pdksh is provided AS IS, with NO WARRANTY, either expressed or
implied.  Also note that although the bulk of the code in pdksh is in the
public domain, some files are copyrighten (but freely distributable) and
subject to certain conditions (eg, don't remove copyright, document any
changes, etc.).

Compiling/Installing:
    * edit options.h and define/undef the options therein.
    * run configure: this is a GNU autoconf configure script that will generate
      a Makefile and a config.h.  Some of the useful options to configure are:
	--prefix=PATH	    indicates the directory tree under which the binary
			    and man page are installed (ie, PATH/bin/ksh and
			    PATH/man/man1/ksh.1).
			    The default prefix is /usr/local.
	--exec-prefix=PATH  overrides --prefix for machine dependent files
			    (ie, the ksh binary)
	--verbose	    show what is being defined as script runs
      Note that you don't have to build in the source directory.  To build
      in a separate directory, do something like:
		$ mkdir objs
		$ cd objs
		$ ../configure --verbose
		....
		$ make
      See the file INSTALL for a complete description of configure and its
      options.
    * miscellaneous configuration notes:
	* If your make doesn't understand VPATH, you must compile in
	  the source directory.
	* On DecStations, MIPS and SONY machines with older C compilers that
	  can't handle "int * volatile x", you should use gcc or turn off
	  optimization.  The problem is configure defines volatile to nothing
	  since the compiler can't handle it properly, but the compiler does
	  optimizations that the volatile is meant to prevent.   So.  Use gcc.
	* On MIPS RISC/os 5.0 systems, sysv environment, <signal.h> is
	  messed up - it defines sigset_t, but not any of the rest of
	  the posix signals (the sigset_t typedef should be in the
	  ifdef KERNEL section) - also doesn't have waitpid() or wait3().
	  Things compile up ok in the svr4 environment, but it dumps core
	  in __start (perhaps our system doesn't have the full svr4
	  environ?).  Try compiling in the bsd43 environ instead (still not
	  perfect - see BUG-REPORTS file).
    * run make: everything should compile and link without problems.
    * run make check: this fires up ksh on a script that checks for some
      known and some fixed bugs.  The script prints the list of tests
      it expects to fail.
    * run make install: this installs ksh (in /usr/local/bin/ksh by default,
      or where ever you told configure to put things).

The following is a list of machines pdksh is known to work on:
    Sun/sun4 SunOS 4.1.3
    Sun/sun4 Solaris 2.3
    Sun/sun386i SunOS 4.0.2
    Sun/sun3 SunOS 4.0.3
    Dec/alpha OSF/1 v2.0
    HP/pa HP-UX 9.01
    -/PC Linux 0.99.15 (Slackware v 1.?)
    -/PC NetBSD 0.9a
    MIPS/m120 RISC/os 5.0 (bsd43 environ)
    Dec/pmax Ultrix 4.2
    Dec/vax Ultrix 2.2
    Dec/vax 4.3BSD+NFS (MtXinu)

You can send bug reports, fixes, and enchancements to pdksh@cs.mun.ca (please
don't assume I will see bug reports that are posted to some newsgroup or
mailing list - I probably won't).
If you are reporting a bug (with or without a fix), please include
	* the version of pdksh you are using (see version.c, or, if you are
	  running pdksh, try echo $KSH_VERSION),
	* the machine, operating system and compiler you are using,
	* and a description of how to repeat the bug (a small shell
	  script that demonstrates the bug is best).
as well as the following, if relevant (if you aren't sure, include them)
	* what options you are using (both options.h options and set -o options)
	* a copy of your config.h (the file generated by the configure script)

Michael Rendell, michael@cs.mun.ca.
