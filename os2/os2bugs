	Bugs and Limitations
	6/96

1. Some of the makefile targets are not yet working.  Those known to
   work include all, uninstall,ksh, config.h, makefile,
   debugtools (only check-fd and check-sigs.), clean, & distclean.
   make check does not work because of a bug in os2 port of ksh. You
   need to run ksh Bugs ksh, or sh Bugs sh as appropriate.

2. You cannot start a full screen session from the windowed ksh command line.

3. Job control is not working and may never work in os/2 (no sigstp,
   sigcont, etc).

4. make check does not work even after you get all of the perl issues
   taken care of.  See bug 5 for the reason.  Use 'ksh Bugs ksh' with
   the supplied Bugs file to check a build.

5. The command 'ksh < filename' does not work properly on this release.
   This is the cause of the make check failure.  Extra \r (carriage returns)
   appear in the input data.

6. ls [B]* fails even when a file Bozo exists.  ls [b]* will work
   due to case folding.  The bug is in the way case folding is managed.
   ls b* or ls B* will work as expected.
