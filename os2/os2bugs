	Bugs and Limitations
	5/8/95

1. Some of the makefile targets are not yet working.  Those known to
   work include all, uninstall, check, ksh, config.h, makefile,
   debugtools (only check-fd and check-sigs.), clean, & distclean.

2. You cannot start a full screen session from the windowed ksh command line.

3. Some 'nmake check' tests require a local /tmp, /bin, /dev, and /etc  
   directory. The bin directory needs a copy of cp, and ksh 
   (called sh). The /etc directory needs a copy of termcap and passwd 
   (or any file with these names). 

4. Job control is not working and may never work in os/2 (no sigstp,
   sigcont, etc).

5. There is some sort of ending status problem associated with opening
   and using a new file descriptor ('exec 5>', for example).
