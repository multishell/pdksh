This is a partial history of this shell gleened from old change logs and
readmes (most of which are still in the misc directory) and the source
code.  Hopefully it is correct and no contributors have been left out
(file a bug report if you spot a problem :-)).

      Arnold Robbins, Lou Salkind, and others?, circa '87; the parts used in
